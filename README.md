# Coder-Challenge
### Description : 
  This project is a React Native built application which fetches data from sensors like Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS) and present it.
  
  ### Theory
  1.Inertial Measurement Unit composed of 3axis of accelerometer,gyroscopea and magnetometer which is called to be as 9 axix IMU.
  2.IMU are used to measure acceleration,angular velocity and magnetic fields.but when combined with fusion software measures orientation,heading and motion.
  3.The combunation of IMU sensor with IMU fusion software called to be as Altitude Heading Reference System (AHRS).
  
  ### Necessity of IMU Sensor
  1.This sensor data brings more accuracy in Global Positioning System.
  2.Tracking motion in consumer electronics like cellphone and video game remotes.
  3.It brings into Augmented Reality(AR) and Virtual Reality(VR) by user head movements.
  4.Maintaining Drone balance by applying "motion" and "orientation information".
  
#### Steps to be followed :
1. Install node in your system.
2. Install npm and expo globally.
3. Start npm.
4. You will see the Expo DevTools will start at a port in your host and opens the default browser.
5. You can select any of the available modes for Simulator and check on the device.
